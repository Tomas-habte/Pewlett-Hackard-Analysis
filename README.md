# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use SQL to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will allow the manager to prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
The analysis has revealed the following:
- There are 72,458 employees that are nearing retirement. 
- The vast majority (70%) of employees nearing retirement have senior titles.  
- Employees with "manager" as their title are the smallest minority with only 2.

- According to the mentorship_eligbility table, there are 1,549 employees who are eligible for the Mentorship Program.

## Summary
There are 72,458 employees that are nearing retirement and only 1,549 employees are eligible for the Mentorship Program. Therefore, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees as they would each need to have many mentees which is not feasible.
