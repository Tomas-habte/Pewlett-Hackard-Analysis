# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use SQL to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will allow the manager to prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
The analysis has revealed the following:
- There are 72,458 employees that are nearing retirement. 
- The vast majority (70%) of employees nearing retirement have senior titles.  
- Employees with "manager" as their title are the smallest minority with only 2.
